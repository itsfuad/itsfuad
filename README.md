### Hi there! 

I'm a software enginner who is focused in highly secured, optimized and maintainable programs. I have a wide field of experience from core machine codes to web technologies. I mostly use typescript to setup a project on the go. My primary languges of development are C++, Typescript and Golang.


### Languages and Tools I use:
