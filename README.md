### Hi there!
I'm a software developer who specializes in creating small software and web programs. I actively develop websites using HTML, CSS and TypeScript, and have experience working with frameworks such as Svelte, React and Angular. I am proficient in using Node.js and have experience working with databases such as MongoDB, Redis and SQLtypes. I have a passion for game development and have experience using JavaScript, C++ and the SFML library to create games. I have also used the Godot engine to develop 2D games. I am still learning 3D game development, but I am able to build 3D models using Blender. I prefer not to use libraries or frameworks most of the time, as starting projects from scratch helps me gain knowledge from the core. My goal is to build a game engine in the future, and I am constantly expanding my knowledge and skills.
